# Practice Sorting Program
A sorting program that I created in order to teach myself about sorting algorithims and what is the most efficient way to sort data. I learned from this project
about the essential coding concept of Big O and learning the importance of efficiency in the industry. The program involves generating a random list of numbers and gives the user
a choice of a linear sort, bubble sort, or merge sort in order to completely sort the list in order from lowest to greatest. The program also times how long it takes a program to sort the list.
